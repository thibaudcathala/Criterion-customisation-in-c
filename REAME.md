# Criterion customisation in c

## Criterion documentation:
The documentation will help you to complete each task:
- Web site: https://criterion.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html
- PDF: [criterion-readthedocs-io-en-stable.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17882077/criterion-readthedocs-io-en-stable.pdf)

## ex00
- Clone this repository
- Go at the root of this repository
- Create a new c filewith a name like "test_interface.c"
- Compile the given my_test.c and your test_interface.c (that is actually empty). `gcc -o my_beautiful_test my_test.c test_interface.c -lcriterion`
- Run the generated binary, it should output somthing like this:

You can see that criterion print a lot of thing, that the part that we will customise.
- Now run you program with as argument `--verbose=3`, it should print nothing, it's what we want, we will go from this to print our own message.
